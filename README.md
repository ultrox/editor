## What is this?

Based on what I learn from [ Federico ](https://tomassetti.me/writing-simple-js-editor/)

Originally my idea was to implement syntax highlighting into one of mine projects, 
since I didn't want to use some huge library to implement syntax
highlighting I decided to make my own html editor.

Findings was rather grate, I always wanted to know how they make those advanced
editors since I wanted to to that audio/git/editor thingy.

Now I know.

I replaced `<textarea>` with 130 lines of code and got shitty version of `<textarea` that can do only the fraction of what `textarea` can do. Good job!! But it has potential!
