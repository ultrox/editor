## What is this?

Entirely based on what I learn from [ Federico ](https://tomassetti.me/writing-simple-js-editor/)

Originally my idea was to implement syntax highlighting into my packagejson.com
project, since I didn't want to use some huge library to implement syntax
highlighting I decided to make my own html editor.

Findings was rather grate, I always wanted to know how they make those advanced
editors since I wanted to to that audio/git/editor.

Now I know.
